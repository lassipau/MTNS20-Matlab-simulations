# Controller design and simulation for an Euler-Bernoulli beam with Kelvin-Voigt damping

These codes contain the Matlab simulations in the manuscript "A Reduced Order Controller for Output Tracking of a Kelvin--Voigt Beam" by Lassi Paunonen and Duy Phan, submitted to the Proceedings of the Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems 2020.

## Requirements

The codes require the Chebfun package (https://chebfun.org/) to be part of Matlab path.

## Usage

The simulations are completed by executing the main file "beamKV1D_MTNS20.m".
